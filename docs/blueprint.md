# **App Name**: PassportInfoXtract

## Core Features:

- Passport Upload: Allow users to upload a passport image or PDF file.
- Information Extraction: Utilize an AI tool to extract key information from the uploaded passport, including first name, last name, date of birth, passport number, and expiration date. The AI tool must have logic to determine when and how to fill each field.
- Data Display: Display the extracted information in a structured and easily readable format.
- Manual Correction: Allow users to manually correct any information that was not accurately extracted by the AI.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Sky blue (#7EC8E3) for a sense of security and reliability, reminiscent of official documents.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F7), to give emphasis to data fields and extracted info while creating sufficient contrast for legibility.
- Accent color: Soft Green (#AEE1CD) to indicate successfully extracted data or valid fields.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look, for high legibility.
- Employ a clean and structured layout to present the extracted information clearly. Use distinct sections for each data field.
- Use simple and recognizable icons to represent different data fields (e.g., a calendar icon for date of birth, an ID card icon for passport number).
- Implement subtle animations, such as a fade-in effect, when displaying extracted information or highlighting corrected fields, in order to reinforce the automated aspect.
